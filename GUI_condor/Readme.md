# Condor GUI

Run condor_gui.py. 
The interface is quite intuitive. It's most useful feature is
the condor pool and job monitoring. This can be done via condor_status, condor_q on terminal.
In the interface those commands are the default screen.

It is recommended to install QDarkStyleSheet (https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QDarkStyleSheet) for a better experience.

You can also create job templates in File > New Job tab, but using the uploaded templates should be enough.
